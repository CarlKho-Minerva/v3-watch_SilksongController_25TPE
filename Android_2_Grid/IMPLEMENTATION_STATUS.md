## 📱 How to Build and Install

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog (2024.2.1) or later
- Android device or emulator with API 24+ (Android 7.0+)
- Both phone and MacBook on same WiFi network

### Build Steps

1. **Open Project in Android Studio**
   ```bash
   cd Android_2_Grid
   # Open this folder in Android Studio
   ```

2. **Sync Gradle**
   - Android Studio will automatically sync Gradle files
   - Wait for dependencies to download
   - If sync fails, click "Sync Now" in notification banner

3. **Build APK**
   - Menu: Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)
   - Or run: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
   - APK will be in: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

4. **Install on Device**
   - Connect Android phone via USB with debugging enabled
   - Click Run (▶️) button in Android Studio
   - Or run: `./gradlew installDebug`
   - Or manually install APK: `adb install app-debug.apk`

### First-Time Setup

1. **Launch App**
   - Open "Button Data Collector" app on phone

2. **Configure IP Address**
   - Click "Change IP Address" button
   - Enter MacBook's IP address (check with `ifconfig` or `ipconfig`)
   - Click "Save"

3. **Start Python Backend** (on MacBook)
   ```bash
   cd src
   python button_data_collector.py  # TODO: Create this script
   ```

4. **Test Connection**
   - Press any button briefly
   - Check MacBook terminal for incoming UDP message
   - Connection status should show "Connected to X.X.X.X"

## 🎮 How to Use

### Basic Collection Workflow

1. **Position Devices**
   - Left wrist: Pixel Watch (should already be streaming)
   - Right hand: Phone with this app

2. **Collect Data**
   - **For WALK/IDLE**: Press and hold button for 5-10 seconds while performing action
   - **For PUNCH/JUMP**: Press and hold button for 1-2 seconds during action
   - **For TURN_LEFT/RIGHT**: Quick press during turn (<1 second)

3. **Monitor Progress**
   - Watch count numbers increase after each release
   - Count colors show data balance:
     - 🔴 Red (0-9): Need more samples
     - 🟡 Yellow (10-29): Building dataset
     - 🟢 Green (30+): Sufficient for training

4. **Data Balancing**
   - Aim for 30-50 samples per gesture
   - Try to keep all counts similar
   - Total time: ~15 minutes for complete balanced dataset

### Button Behavior

| Button      | Duration  | When to Press |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| WALK        | 5-10 sec  | While walking in place |
| IDLE        | 5-10 sec  | While standing still |
| PUNCH       | 1-2 sec   | During punch motion |
| JUMP        | 1-2 sec   | During jump |
| TURN_LEFT   | <1 sec    | During left turn |
| TURN_RIGHT  | <1 sec    | During right turn |

### Haptic Feedback

- **Short vibration (50ms)**: Button pressed - start recording
- **Long vibration (100ms)**: Button released - recording saved

### Visual Feedback

- **Gray button**: Not recording
- **Green button**: Currently recording this action
- **Elevated card**: Button appears "lifted" when pressed

## 📋 UDP Protocol

### Label Event Format

**Start Event (button pressed):**
```json
{
  "type": "label_event",
  "action": "punch",
  "event": "start",
  "timestamp_ms": 1697654789123
}
```

**End Event (button released):**
```json
{
  "type": "label_event",
  "action": "punch",
  "event": "end",
  "timestamp_ms": 1697654789891,
  "count": 15
}
```

### Network Settings

- **Protocol**: UDP
- **Port**: 12345
- **Default IP**: 192.168.10.234 (configurable in app)
- **Message Format**: JSON string as UTF-8 bytes

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before starting actual data collection:

- [ ] App builds and installs successfully
- [ ] All 6 buttons are visible and labeled correctly
- [ ] Press and hold button changes color to green
- [ ] Release button returns to gray
- [ ] Count increments after release
- [ ] Haptic feedback works on press and release
- [ ] IP address can be changed and persists after app restart
- [ ] Counts persist after app restart
- [ ] UDP messages received on MacBook (check Python script logs)
- [ ] Connection status shows "Connected to X.X.X.X"
- [ ] Reset button clears all counts

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Button doesn't respond
- Try pressing and holding for at least 0.5 seconds
- Make sure you're pressing within the button card area
- Check if button color changes to green

### Count doesn't increment
- Ensure you held the button until release
- Check if second vibration occurred (should be longer)
- Look for errors in Android Studio logcat

### UDP messages not received
- Verify both devices on same WiFi network
- Check MacBook firewall settings (allow UDP port 12345)
- Confirm IP address is correct (run `ifconfig` on MacBook)
- Try pinging MacBook from phone
- Check Python script is running and listening

### Connection status shows error
- Network unreachable: Check WiFi connection
- Connection refused: Python script not running
- Invalid IP: Double-check IP address format

### Counts reset unexpectedly
- This is expected on app uninstall
- Counts should persist across app restarts
- Check SharedPreferences in Android Studio Device File Explorer

## 🔧 Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Why Jetpack Compose?**
   - Modern declarative UI framework
   - Less boilerplate than XML layouts
   - Easy state management with `remember` and `mutableStateOf`
   - Built-in gesture detection

2. **Why ViewModel?**
   - Survives configuration changes (screen rotation)
   - Separates business logic from UI
   - Lifecycle-aware
   - Easy testing

3. **Why SharedPreferences?**
   - Simple key-value storage
   - Perfect for counts and IP address
   - No need for Room database
   - Data persists across app restarts

4. **Why detectTapGestures?**
   - Provides `onPress` with `tryAwaitRelease()`
   - Exactly what we need for press-and-hold
   - No need for custom gesture detector
   - Works well with Compose

│   └── Reset button
│
DataCollectorViewModel.kt
├── State management (counts, recording state)
├── UDP client (send label events)
└── Persistence (SharedPreferences)
```

### Potential Enhancements (Future)

- [ ] NSD (Network Service Discovery) for automatic IP detection
- [ ] Session management (start/stop recording session)
- [ ] Export session metadata as JSON
- [ ] Live sensor data visualization
- [ ] Statistics dashboard (total samples, session duration)
- [ ] Dark mode support
- [ ] Landscape orientation support
- [ ] External Bluetooth button support

**Resolution**: Build locally with Android Studio where network access is available. All code is complete and ready to build.

**AGP Version**: Using 8.5.2 (compatible with Gradle 8.13)  
**Min SDK**: 24 (Android 7.0)  
**Target SDK**: 36 (Android 15)  
**Kotlin**: 2.0.21  
**Compose**: 2024.09.00

All dependencies are standard AndroidX libraries available from Google Maven.
