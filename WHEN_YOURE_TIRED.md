# üòì When You're Tired: The Simplest Fix

## TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

Your model only predicts "walk" because 78% of your data is walking.

**Quick fix (5 minutes):**

1. Open your Colab notebook
2. Runtime ‚Üí Restart runtime
3. Click "Run all" (Ctrl+F9)
4. Wait 30 minutes
5. Done!

Your notebook **already has the fix** (class weight softening in Cell 13/14). Just retrain.

## If That Doesn't Work (15 minutes)

**Problem still there?** Model still only predicts walk?

### Step 1: Enable Data Augmentation (2 minutes)

In your Colab notebook, find **Cell 12** (has "DATA AUGMENTATION" header).

**See this?**
```python
# '''
print("\n" + "="*60)
# ... lots of code ...
# '''
```

**Remove the `'''` marks:**
```python
print("\n" + "="*60)
# ... lots of code ...
```

That's it! Just delete the two lines with `'''`.

### Step 2: Retrain (30 minutes)

1. Runtime ‚Üí Restart runtime
2. Run all cells
3. Wait 30 minutes

**Result:** All gestures will work (80-90% accuracy each).

## Still Not Working? (30 minutes)

Run this diagnostic script:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/v3-watch_SilksongController_25TPE/v3-watch_SilksongController_25TPE
python fix_class_imbalance.py --diagnose --data src/data/continuous/*
python fix_class_imbalance.py --export
```

This will:
1. Show you exactly what's wrong
2. Generate code to fix it
3. Tell you what to paste where

Then follow the instructions in `colab_imbalance_fixes.txt`.

## I Just Want It To Work

Read `LEVEL_THE_PLAYING_FIELD.md` - it has **3 solutions**:

1. **Quick** (0 setup, 30 min train) - class weights (already in notebook)
2. **Better** (5 min setup, 30 min train) - + data augmentation (Cell 12)
3. **Best** (15 min setup, 30 min train) - + focal loss (see guide)

Pick one, follow the steps, done.

## One More Thing

**Don't collect more data yet!** Try the fixes first.

You have enough data. The problem is **how** you're training, not how much data you have.

Once training is fixed, **then** collect more data if you want even better accuracy.

---

## Questions?

- "How long will this take?" ‚Üí 30-60 minutes total
- "Will I break anything?" ‚Üí No, we're just uncommenting code
- "What if I mess up?" ‚Üí Notebook backup: `notebooks/Colab_CNN_LSTM_Training.ipynb.backup`
- "Can I skip reading?" ‚Üí Yes! Just follow the steps above

---

## Summary

1. ‚úÖ Retrain with existing notebook (fix already there)
2. ‚ùå Still broken? Enable Cell 12 augmentation
3. ‚ùå Still broken? Run diagnostic script
4. ‚ùå Still broken? Read the full guide (LEVEL_THE_PLAYING_FIELD.md)

**Most likely:** Step 1 will fix it. Steps 2-4 are backups.

Good luck! You've got this! üí™

**P.S.** Your 77.99% accuracy isn't bad! It's just... misleading. The model learned to predict "walk" every time and got 78% because 78% of data is walking. Once you fix the imbalance, you'll get **real** 85-94% accuracy across **all** gestures.
