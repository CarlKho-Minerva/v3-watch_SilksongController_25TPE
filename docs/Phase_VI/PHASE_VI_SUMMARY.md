## Integration with Previous Work

### Previous PR: Class Imbalance Solutions
The previous PR provided three approaches:
1. Softened class weights
2. Data augmentation
3. Focal loss

### Phase VI: Watson's Approach
Adds a fourth approach:
4. Two-stage fine-tuning

### Relationship

**Watson's approach is:**
- **Alternative** to direct training when it fails
- **Complementary** to data augmentation (use both)
- **Foundation** for understanding why class weights cause problems

**Use Watson when:**
- Previous approaches failed
- Extreme imbalance (>50x)
- Need maximum stability

**Use previous approaches when:**
- Moderate imbalance (<20x)
- Limited time
- Simpler workflow preferred

**Best combination:**
- Data augmentation (reduce imbalance)
- + Watson's two-stage (stable training)
- = 90-96% accuracy, production-ready

## Key Concepts

### The Core Problem
```
Class Weights + All Layers Training = Gradient Chaos
                    â†“
            Model Collapse
```

### Watson's Solution
```
Phase 1: Verify architecture works (sandbox test)
Phase 2: Train CNN alone (learn stable features)
Phase 3: Freeze CNN, train LSTM (stable classification)
                    â†“
         No Gradient Chaos!
```

### Why It Works
- CNN learns features WITHOUT being destabilized by weights
- LSTM learns classification FROM stable features
- Class weights can be aggressive (CNN is frozen)
- Result: Stable, high-performance model

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success
- âœ… Validation accuracy > 60% on toy dataset
- âœ… Training curves show learning
- âœ… No NaN losses

### Phase 2 Success
- âœ… Validation accuracy > 80% on full dataset
