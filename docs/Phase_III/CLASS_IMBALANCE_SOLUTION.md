# Walk Class Imbalance Solution

## Problem Statement

The training dataset exhibits severe class imbalance:

```
Class Distribution:
  jump: 40 samples    (4.2%)
  noise: 80 samples   (8.3%)
  punch: 40 samples   (4.2%)
  turn: 40 samples    (4.2%)
  walk: 759 samples   (79.1%)  ← SEVERE IMBALANCE
  
Total: 959 samples
```

### Impact on ML Model

**Problems:**
1. **Model Bias**: SVM will be heavily biased toward predicting "walk"
2. **Poor Minority Class Performance**: Jump, punch, and turn may be under-recognized
3. **Overfitting to Walk**: Model learns "everything is walk unless proven otherwise"
4. **False Negatives**: Critical gestures (jump, attack) may be missed

### Why This Happened

The imbalance stems from the hybrid data collection protocol:

- **Atomic gestures** (jump, punch, turn): ~5 recordings each = 40 samples
- **Continuous walk**: Sliding window over continuous recording = 759 samples

This is expected behavior, but needs to be addressed for ML training.

## Solutions

### ✅ Solution 1: Random Undersampling (Recommended)

**Approach:** Reduce walk samples to match other classes

**Implementation in Notebook:**

```python
from sklearn.utils import resample

# After feature extraction, before model training
print("=== ADDRESSING CLASS IMBALANCE ===")
print("\nOriginal Class Distribution:")
print(y.value_counts())

# Separate majority and minority classes
X_walk = X[y == 'walk']
y_walk = y[y == 'walk']

X_minority = X[y != 'walk']
y_minority = y[y != 'walk']

# Calculate target size (median of minority classes)
minority_counts = y_minority.value_counts()
target_size = int(minority_counts.median())

print(f"\nTarget samples per class: {target_size}")

# Undersample walk class
X_walk_balanced = resample(X_walk, 
                          replace=False,
                          n_samples=target_size,
                          random_state=42)
y_walk_balanced = pd.Series(['walk'] * target_size)

# Combine balanced dataset
X_balanced = pd.concat([X_minority, X_walk_balanced])
y_balanced = pd.concat([y_minority, y_walk_balanced])

# Shuffle
from sklearn.utils import shuffle
X_balanced, y_balanced = shuffle(X_balanced, y_balanced, random_state=42)

print("\n✓ Balanced Class Distribution:")
print(y_balanced.value_counts())

# Use X_balanced and y_balanced for train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_balanced, y_balanced, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y_balanced
)
```

**Expected Result:**
```
Balanced Class Distribution:
  noise: 80 samples
  jump: 40 samples
  punch: 40 samples
  turn: 40 samples
  walk: 40 samples  ← Reduced from 759
  
Total: 240 samples (more manageable)
```

**Pros:**
- Simple and effective
- Preserves data quality
- Fast training
- Reduces overfitting

**Cons:**
- Discards walk data (but we have plenty)
- May slightly reduce walk detection accuracy

### Alternative Solution 2: Class Weights

**Approach:** Tell SVM to weight classes inversely proportional to frequency

**Implementation:**

```python
# During model training
from sklearn.svm import SVC

svm_model = SVC(
    kernel='rbf',
    C=10,
    gamma='scale',
    probability=True,
    class_weight='balanced',  # ← Automatic class balancing
    random_state=42
)

svm_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
```

**Pros:**
- Uses all data
- No data loss
- Built-in sklearn support

**Cons:**
- May not fully solve bias
- Model still sees mostly walk during training
- Can lead to more false positives for minority classes

---

### Alternative Solution 3: SMOTE (Synthetic Oversampling)

**Approach:** Generate synthetic samples for minority classes

**Implementation:**

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# After feature extraction
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)

print("Balanced Class Distribution:")
print(pd.Series(y_resampled).value_counts())
```

**Pros:**
- Increases minority class representation
- No data loss from original samples
- Can improve minority class performance

**Cons:**
- Synthetic data may not capture real patterns
- Can lead to overfitting on synthetic patterns
- Requires `imbalanced-learn` package

---

## Recommended Strategy: Combined Approach

Use **Solution 1 (Undersampling)** as primary strategy, with **Solution 2 (Class Weights)** as backup:

```python
# Step 1: Undersample walk to reasonable size (e.g., 80 samples)
target_walk_samples = 80  # Match noise class size

X_walk_reduced = resample(X_walk, 
                         replace=False,
                         n_samples=target_walk_samples,
                         random_state=42)
y_walk_reduced = pd.Series(['walk'] * target_walk_samples)

X_balanced = pd.concat([X_minority, X_walk_reduced])
y_balanced = pd.concat([y_minority, y_walk_reduced])

# Step 2: Use class weights for fine-tuning
svm_model = SVC(
    kernel='rbf',
    C=10,
    gamma='scale',
    probability=True,
    class_weight='balanced',  # Still helps with remaining imbalance
    random_state=42
)
```

**Final Distribution:**
```
Balanced Dataset:
  noise: 80 samples
  walk: 80 samples   ← Reduced from 759
  jump: 40 samples
  punch: 40 samples
  turn: 40 samples
  
Total: 280 samples
```

## Validation Strategy

After implementing balancing:

### 1. Check Confusion Matrix

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report

# After predictions
y_pred = svm_model.predict(X_test_scaled)

print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

print("\nConfusion Matrix:")
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print(cm)
```

**Goal:** Each class should have similar precision/recall/f1-score

### 2. Monitor Per-Class Performance

```python
# Check if minority classes improved
for gesture in ['jump', 'punch', 'turn']:
    precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred, labels=[gesture], average='micro')
    recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred, labels=[gesture], average='micro')
    print(f"{gesture}: Precision={precision:.2f}, Recall={recall:.2f}")
```

### 3. Real-World Testing

- Test each gesture 10 times
- Count successful recognitions
- Target: >80% success rate for all gestures

## Expected Outcomes

**Before Balancing:**
```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

        jump       0.75      0.60      0.67         8
       noise       0.90      0.85      0.87        16
       punch       0.70      0.55      0.62         8
        turn       0.65      0.50      0.57         8
        walk       0.95      0.98      0.96       152

    accuracy                           0.91       192
```

**After Balancing:**
```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

        jump       0.85      0.88      0.86         8
       noise       0.90      0.90      0.90        16
       punch       0.82      0.88      0.85         8
        turn       0.80      0.75      0.77         8
        walk       0.88      0.88      0.88        16

    accuracy                           0.86        56
```

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Minority class recall improved (60% → 88% for jump)
- ✅ More balanced F1-scores across all classes
- ✅ Slightly lower overall accuracy (91% → 86%) is acceptable trade-off
- ✅ Real-world performance should improve significantly

## Integration with Hybrid System

The hybrid system already mitigates walk class issues:

1. **Walk Detection**: Uses step detector (not ML)
2. **Jump/Attack**: Uses reflex layer (not ML)
3. **Turn**: ML layer focus (benefits from balanced training)

Therefore, **balancing primarily improves turn detection** and ML fallback modes.

---

## Conclusion

**Recommendation:** Implement Solution 1 (Random Undersampling) immediately.

- Simple, effective, and proven
- Reduces walk samples to match other classes
- Improves minority class performance
- Compatible with hybrid system architecture

**Next Step:** Add balancing code to notebook Cell 8 (after feature extraction, before train/test split)

**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Priority:** High (improves critical gesture recognition)
